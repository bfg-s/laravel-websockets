# Installation

Laravel WebSockets can be installed via composer:

```bash
composer require beyondcode/laravel-websockets
```

The package will automatically register a service provider.

This package comes with a migration to store statistic information while running your WebSocket server. You can publish the migration file using:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BeyondCode\LaravelWebSockets\WebSocketsServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

Run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Next, you need to publish the WebSocket configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BeyondCode\LaravelWebSockets\WebSocketsServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the default content of the config file that will be published as  `config/websockets.php`:

```php
return [

    /*
     * This package comes with multi tenancy out of the box. Here you can
     * configure the different apps that can use the webSockets server.
     *
     * Optionally you can disable client events so clients cannot send
     * messages to each other via the webSockets.
